# Compiler Design

## What is this about ?

I created this repository for my university class, `Compiler Design`.

Useful for:
- Those who have compiler class
- Those who like to read about compilers
- And those who like to explore the world

As I'm still compiler class student, content of this repository will update with my knowledge progress. So, be my guest, take your sit and enjoy your journey.
